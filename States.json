Bereft of chaos and cacophony, it provides the perfect escape from the hustle bustle of city life. The highlight of the pristine beach are the hundreds of red crabs that are found on the shores which also give a perfect crimson colour to the beach. Besides, unlike the usual crescent shaped beaches, this one is an inverted crimson in shape. Fringed by dense eucalyptus, tamarisk and casuarina trees, the secluded beach is perfect to just laze on a hammock and spend some time in solitude amidst the sun, sea and sand."

A favourite among the adventure junkees, the rafting has a series of rapids ranging from Grade 1 to 4. However, the difficult rapids are only allowed to the professionals or the seasonal trainers as it is risky. You should definitely try this activity when in Darjeeling."
